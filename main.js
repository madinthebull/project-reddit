    Part 2
        -We now want users to be able to leave comments on each post. When a user clicks 'comments' (above each post) it should toggle the comments and input box visible/hidden.
        -When a user clicks the 'x' next to a comment, it should delete it.
        -When a user fills out the two comment inputs and clicks 'Post Comment' it should immediately add the comment to the list of comments.
        -when a user clicks 'remove' above a post, it should remove the post, too.
